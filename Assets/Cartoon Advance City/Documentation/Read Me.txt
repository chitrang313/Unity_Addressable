Documentation of 3D City environment Asset

In this Environment, we have created all the models separatedly, all the models are reuseable and it's depends upon us that how we can use and place in the environment.
we have created Buildings, roads, trees, footpaths, bench, pillars, stairs, electric house, watertank, doors, windows, boundry walls,  windows mirror, garbage box, street lights, traffic light, house main door, 3 grounds, shop shutter, wood fence and slide stairs etc. 
Models are made with only 5 texture. Models are very low poly. The 3D City Environment pack consists of different objects created individually, so you can use them to create an intuitive and eye-catching user interface for your 3D game or animated video. The vectors can be edited and placed at any scene in the game/video to give it a more defined look. Colliders are placed on the necessary objects.

we have different folders:
